# Project Title
A small script to collate data from the [Stack Overflow jobs rss feed](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/feed?location=melbourne). This should be stored in a database, and data should be analysed over (at least) the technologies used in jobs.

### Prerequisites

 - Python
 - Python modules: urllib.request

### TODO

* Integrate pipenv
* Set up a database(tbd) to store job postings
* Display analysis of most common technologies used in jobs

### Attribution

Thanks to Stack Overflow for job posting data. This project is intended for
non-commercial purposes.
